Hello!

This my attempt at creating a GUI C calculator using the GTK4 API, hence if you do not have these libraries installed then this code may not run on your local machine. I can provide links if you are interested in installing GTK

Setting up GTK for GNU/Linux and Unix : https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/linux
For Windows: https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/windows
For Mac OS: https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/macos


Any C/GTK programming experts, please let me know if there is any way I can write this application in a much more efficient way, I am always looking to improve, thank you!

May look to improve the calculator in the future by adding output history or other minor improvements.
